We're using Emotion here as it supports SSR with Next.js right out the box, while Styled Components require additional config. The syntax is identical for our purposes.

I'm pretty happy with this one, it was my first time building a whole CRUD app, There were a lot of subtle challenges here concerning the state management and implementing the drag and drop using the react-beautiful-dnd espacialy because I am using Nextjs as it's SSR so this can mess up how some librariers operates.

Why react -beautiful-dnd
there are a lot of libraries out there that allow the drag and drop interaction with react, so why react-beautiful-dnd
Simply beacause it offers a good drag and drop experience as it's a higher level abstraction specifically built for lists vertical, horizontal, movement between lists, nested lists and so on.

I am happy using different react hook to implement the todo logic (useReducer and useContext)

concerning the light/dark toggle it may be other different approachs to build in Nextjs, I chose to use CSS varaibles, simple method that meets  accessibility best practices, persists on reload and takes a user's preferred colour scheme into consideration. It also doesn't suffer from the dreaded 'flash' of incorrect colours on initial load.

One approach that I may change on similar future project is exploring a diffrent tool rahter than firebase. I'd like to explore animation more, and focus more on accessibility, and learn how to use a screen reader and test the app accessibility using a keyboard.
